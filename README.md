# Decision-Tree-Visualization
Decision Tree
A decision tree is a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is a flowchart-like model of decisions that uses a tree-like structure to show the sequence of decisions and the possible consequences of each decision.

Features

Supports both classification and regression tasks
Handles categorical and numerical features
Supports missing values
Handles imbalanced datasets
Supports pruning and tuning hyperparameters
Installation

To install the Decision Tree, simply clone this repository and run the following command:

pip install .
Usage

To use the Decision Tree, simply create an instance of the DecisionTree class and train it on your dataset. Here is an example:

from decision_tree import DecisionTree

# Create a DecisionTree instance
tree = DecisionTree()

# Train the tree on your dataset
tree.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on a new dataset
y_pred = tree.predict(X_test)
Hyperparameters

The Decision Tree has several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve its performance. These include:

max_depth: The maximum depth of the tree
min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node
max_features: The maximum number of features to consider at each split
